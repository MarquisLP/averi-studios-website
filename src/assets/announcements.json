      "__html": "We're excited to announce that World Scribe will soon be coming to the web as a web app!<br />This new app will have all of the Android app's functionality, alongside new features such as custom Categories.<br /><br />Before the app launches, we'd like to hear YOUR feedback on the current prototype. If you're interested in becoming a beta tester, please send an email from a Gmail account to:<br/><br/>averistudios@gmail.com<br/><br/>The app uses Google Authentication, so the email MUST be from a Gmail account.<br/>Also note that due to server load, we cannot guarantee you a spot on the testing team. We will respond to you via email to let you know if you've been accepted or not.<br/><br/>Q: Will development of the Android app be abandoned?<br/>A: Nope! The Android app will continue receiving updates for bug fixes and other small improvements. However, major new features will likely go to the web app instead, so stay tuned!"
