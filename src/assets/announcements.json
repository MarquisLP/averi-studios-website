If you're interested in becoming a beta tester, please send an email from a Gmail account to:<br/><br/><b>averistudios@gmail.com</b><br/>The subject line of the email MUST begin with <b>BETA-SIGNUP</b>.<br/><br/>The app uses Google Authentication, so the email MUST be from a Gmail account.<br/>Also note that due to server load, we cannot always guarantee a spot on the team. We will respond to you via email to let you know if you've been accepted or not.<br/><br/><b>Q:</b> Will development of the Android app be abandoned?<br/><b>A:</b> Nope! The Android app will continue receiving updates for bug fixes and other small improvements. However, major new features will likely go to the web app instead."
